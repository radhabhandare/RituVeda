          <h2>Ancient Vedic Knowledge</h2>
          <p>
            Unraveling the wisdom of ancient traditions and temple practices, we aim to educate
            and raise awareness about the spiritual and scientific aspects of menstruation.
            <br />üåø In Vedic culture, menstruation was seen as a natural detoxification process where the body cleansed itself physically and energetically.
            <br />Ancient texts describe how menstruation was synchronized with the moon cycles, linking feminine energy (Shakti) with cosmic balance.
            <br />üåô Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medical system, emphasized balance of the three doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) for menstrual well-being.
            <br />Diet, herbs, and yoga were recommended to ease menstrual discomfort and support reproductive health.
            <br />Practices like Abhyanga (self-massage) and consuming cooling foods were suggested to maintain hormonal balance.
            <br />üìú Today, many are rediscovering Vedic perspectives on menstruation to break societal stigma and promote menstrual health.
            <br />The fusion of ancient wisdom with modern awareness helps individuals embrace menstruation with pride, not shame.
            <br />Reviving respectful and holistic approaches can lead to better menstrual health, emotional well-being, and empowerment.

          <h2>Holistic Menstrual Health</h2>
          <p>
            We advocate for natural remedies, including yoga and Ayurveda, to help individuals
            manage their menstrual cycles effectively and without stigma.
            <br />üßò Reducing stress and balancing hormones.
            <br />Improving blood circulation to the pelvic area.
            <br />Releasing tension in the lower back and abdomen.
            <br />üçé A balanced diet supports hormonal health and reduces menstrual discomfort. Focus on:
            <br />- Iron-rich foods (spinach, lentils, dates) to replenish blood loss.
            <br />- Omega-3 fatty acids (flaxseeds, walnuts) to reduce inflammation.
            <br />- Hydration (herbal teas, coconut water) to ease bloating.
            <br />Avoid processed foods, caffeine, and excess sugar, which can worsen cramps and mood swings.
            <br />üî• Energy Shifts During the Menstrual Cycle:
            <br />Ancient yogic texts state that during menstruation, a woman's pranic energy (life force) is directed inward.
            <br />It was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity and instead focus on self-care, meditation, and reflection.
            <br />This time was considered a period of deep connection with intuition and inner wisdom.
