      <p>
        Menstrual health education and open conversations can empower women and
        girls to take charge of their well-being. Here are some ways to foster
        empowerment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Access to Resources:</strong> Ensuring women have access to
          affordable menstrual products, healthcare services, and educational
          materials reduces absenteeism from school or work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Breaking Taboos:</strong> Open dialogues about menstruation in
          families, schools, and communities help dismantle negative stereotypes
          and shame.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Support Networks:</strong> Encouraging peer support groups,
          community workshops, and online forums can provide women a safe space
          to share experiences and advice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Physical Well-Being:</strong> Regular exercise, dance, or
          yoga can help manage menstrual symptoms and improve mental health,
          boosting overall confidence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By educating and supporting women, societies can foster resilience,
        leadership, and innovationâ€”ultimately driving positive change at every
        level.
      </p>
