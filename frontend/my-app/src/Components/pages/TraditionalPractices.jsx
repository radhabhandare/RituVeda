      <p>
        Throughout history, communities have developed various practices to
        manage and honor the menstrual cycle. While some can be supportive and
        comforting, others may stem from misconceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Herbal Remedies:</strong> Many cultures use herbal infusions
          or teas to alleviate cramps and discomfort. Ginger, chamomile, and
          turmeric are commonly used for their anti-inflammatory properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Massage and Movement:</strong> Traditional medicine systems,
          like Ayurveda, often recommend gentle massage and certain yoga poses
          or dances to ease menstrual pain and improve circulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Isolation Practices:</strong> In some places, women may be
          asked to stay separate during menstruation. While this can offer rest,
          it may also perpetuate stigma if not done by choice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Itâ€™s essential to distinguish beneficial cultural wisdom from outdated
        restrictions. Combining traditional knowledge with modern medical advice
        can lead to holistic menstrual care.
