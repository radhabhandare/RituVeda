          <strong>Respecting Taboos:</strong> In some regions, menstruation is
          surrounded by taboos that limit women's activities. These practices,
          though sometimes restrictive, often stem from deep-rooted cultural
          beliefs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rituals and Ceremonies:</strong> Certain cultures hold special
          ceremonies to honor a girlâ€™s first period, viewing it as a milestone
          marking womanhood.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shifting Perspectives:</strong> With increased awareness and
          education, more communities are redefining traditions to be inclusive
          and empowering.
